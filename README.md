# Express-Blog-Application
![Tests workflow Status](https://github.com/techemmy/Express-Blog-Application/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

This is an improvement from the [initial express app](https://github.com/techemmy/Blog-Web-Application) I built.

It is still in progress but these are the imminent changes
- Convert project architecture to MVC  ✅
- Transform synchronous operations to asynchronous operations ✅
- Ensure efficient code operations ✅
- Proper error handling
- Test the app functions: in progress 🚧
- Documenting the code


To start the app, make sure the database URL is set in a .env file and run

`npm run start`
