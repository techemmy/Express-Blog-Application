# Express-Blog-Application
This is an improvement from the [initial express app](https://github.com/techemmy/Blog-Web-Application) I built.

It is still in progress but these are the imminent changes
- Convert project architecture to MVC  ✅
- Transform synchronous operations to asynchronous operations ✅
- Ensure efficient code operations
- Proper error handling
- Test the app functions
- Documenting the code


To start the app, make sure the database URL is set in a .env file and run

`node app`
